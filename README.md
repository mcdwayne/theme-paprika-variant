# Paprika theme variant

This Mautic email theme was made by forking [the mautic/theme-paprika](https://github.com/mautic/theme-paprika) repo.

I do not own any of the images in this repo. They are here used as fair use for educational purposes and to promote this awesome band! 

Hopefully, this repo helps people learn to make themes by forking and modifying existing themes. It is a great step in the direction of becoming a developer!
